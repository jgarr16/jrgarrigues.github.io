about: I'm John, tinkerer and future developer from Baltimore, MD, USA. Iâ€™m currently working as an IT project manager in the public sector, but I am a lifelong learner and always strive to challenge myself. Right now I'm teaching myself how to code with Python with intentions to move on to various flavors of JavaScript later on.</p>
