My personal portfolio website; theme built on top of one built with Jekyll and Github Pages by [Matt Greenfield](https://github.com/mattgreenfield/mattgreenfield.github.io).

Styles are compiled using Sass. To make a change, cd in to the `/_src` folder and run `gulp`.

Testing can be done by running `jekyll serve --watch` in the root of the project. The command line will then provide an address / server port.
