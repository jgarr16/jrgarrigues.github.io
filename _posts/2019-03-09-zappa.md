!["Frank Zappa Way"](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/26/49/f8/frank-zappa-way-in-downtown.jpg)

Who would have thunk? 

That Frank Zappa was a native Baltimorean? Totally caught me off guard when I stumbled across this little tid-bit while surfing around on a website that somebody referenced in class. It seems that he is a local legend of sorts; to the point that his bust is displayed in front of the downtown library and a nearby street was named after him.
