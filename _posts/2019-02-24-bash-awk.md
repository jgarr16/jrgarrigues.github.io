I am trying to collate a series of .csv log files that are named by date (e.g., 2019-02-24.csv). There are a bunch of them, so I'm trying to script the process. I've crafted an AWK script that combines individual files: 

```
awk ' FNR==1 { while (/"_time",PIN,FULLNAME,OFFICE,Acronym,Name/) getline; } 1 { print } ' 2019-01-01.csv >> usage_history.csv
```

But I am failing when I try to string the AWK commands together with a control loop in BASH:

```
for i in {01..31}; do echo "awk ' FNR==1 { while (/\"_time\",PIN,FULLNAME,OFFCODE,Acronym,Name/) getline; } 1 { print } ' 2019-01-$i.csv >> user_history.csv"; done
```

When I run this, it prints out the correct commands to the command line, but the awk scripts are not executed (they only get printed). If I run it without `echo`, I get errors telling me that the file doesn't exist; though all files are present: 

```
bash: awk ' FNR==1 { while (/"_time",PIN,FULLNAME,OFFCODE,Acronym,Name/) getline; } 1 { print } ' 2019-01-01.csv >> user_history.csv: No such file or directory
```

Got some help from Stack Overflow and modified my bash loop to this: 

```
 for i in {01..31}; do awk '!/"_time",PIN,FULLNAME,OFFCODE,Acronym,Name/' 2019-01-$i.csv >>user_history.csv;done
```

The commands after ```do``` should not be quoted.
And what you were doing essentially equals ignore title lines, right?
The ```{print}``` after 1 is unnecessary, because sigle 1 implies the ```{print}```.
