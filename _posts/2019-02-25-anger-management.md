!["Anger management"](/images/anger.png)

Why is it that some people are so damn mean? There are a million ways to look at the world, but for some, there's only one way to interact with it - viscious, cruel, bitter... Angry! 

What drives people to be this way? What is it that's in a person that can make them so antagonistic to everyone that they encounter? I guess it's a blessing that I don't know and somehow I cannot relate to people that are always negative, but the flipside is that I still have to deal with them because there are just so damn many of them out there. 

...but I don't have to like it! 

More to come, once I've calmed down! 

Selah!
