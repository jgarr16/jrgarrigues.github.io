Happy birthday to my brother, Mike on this
!["Friday the Thirteenth!"](https://s-i.huffpost.com/gen/2609274/thumbs/o-UNLUCKY-BLACK-CAT-570.jpg)

This [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/14/austin-is-piloting-blockchain-to-improve-homeless-services/) highlights the use of blockchain as a tool to help homeless people in Austin, TX. This is a great example of a socially-responsible use of technology. In stark opposition to the mostly dour news coming from the tech biggies today (e.g., the [facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal](http://fortune.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-what-happened/) or [Google's tracking of your physical location](https://www.cultofmac.com/100953/google-can-track-your-iphone-ipad-or-macbook-to-your-physical-address-locationgate/)) it highlights some of the good things that can come from tech. 

It will be interesting to watch and see how Austin progresses in this challenge. Seems like there is a lot of activity underway in the heart of the Lone Star State. Best wishes to them all!
