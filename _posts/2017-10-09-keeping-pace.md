### Introduction ###

Technology is the enabler of modern economies. More than any other tool, it serves as a launching platform for products and services in every business sector and the speed at which it changes is daunting. Keeping pace with changes in technology is imperative for today’s business strategist; at least those that want to stay in business. You don’t have to look far to find examples of companies that didn’t keep pace with technology - just search the Internet for Kodak, Blockbuster, Tower Records, or Barnes & Noble to get a sample of once prosperous organizations that fell prey to technological obsolescence. This paper takes a look at what technology is, why it is important to us, whose responsibility it is, and starts the discussion about how we can manage it. 
  
### What is Technology? ###

Today, when we hear the term ‘technology,’ we often think of electronics, the Internet, and highly-paid employees from the Silicon Valley, but it’s much more than that. Technology refers to any item that assists people in accomplishing tasks, and it has been around as long as humans have been using tools. David Wood described technology as the practical application of scientific knowledge, and goes on to point out that the first technological advances included such things as fire, the wheel, clubs (as weapons), and other instruments that modern humans likely would not probably not take into consideration when pondering the topic. 

Until recently, technology has advanced at a slow and steady pace, perhaps with brief upticks centered around episodic events like wars or the Renaissance. We started to see an increase around the mid-1700s with the advent of the Industrial Revolution which was fueled by a number of technological improvements. But even then, one could keep up with the amount of change with relative ease. It was the dawn of the Information Age that brought the staggering amount of change that we see today. Digital (or electronic) technologies also became prevalent during this period, which helps to explain the common assumption that technology is digital in nature. 
  
### Why is it Important? ###

The most significant issue facing management today is the need to keep pace with technology. History is full of enterprises that once dominated business sectors, but got a little too comfortable on their lofty perches, only to be knocked off by startups that were paying attention. 

Kodak, the film giant that was once synonymous with pictures and memories, failed to acknowledge the advent of digital photography until it was way too late. Blockbuster Video succumbed to Netflix, the online video behemoth, much in the same manner that Tower Records bowed to Apple Music, or Barnes and Noble is shuttering many of it brick and mortar shops in response to Amazon.com. There is a never-ending list of the victims of technology; companies that dominated their industries, but allowed themselves to get too comfortable and failed to keep up with advancements in technology. 

The bottom line is that ignoring technology eventually leads to obsolescence. An organization that wants to remain viable needs to stay abreast of the technological landscape by keeping tabs on the tools that others are using that could influence their domain. 

For example, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is tasked to provide retirement, disability, and survivors’ benefits to tens of millions of beneficiaries. According to SSA's web site (2017) there were more than sixty-one million beneficiaries in June of 2017, and that number grows every year. With a customer base of this size, it is imperative that SSA keeps current with the different methods of communicating with them, and the methods are not stagnant. 

The customer base is becoming more technologically savvy year-by-year, and they ways that they communicate are changing. Thirty years ago, people that wanted information or services from SSA went in to an SSA field office and had a face-to-face conversation. Twenty years ago, those people started calling SSA on the phone to conduct the same kinds of business. Today, they want to do the same thing online, using email and chat. What's next? Will SSA's customers want to apply for benefits using facebook, or Twitter? Only time will tell.

SSA is a public entity, so the timeline described above might seem slow to technologists in the private sector, but the it's the same deal there. If strategies change this much over time for SSA, you can imagine the impact that technological change might have in a for-profit environment. 
  
### Who is Responsible? ###

Once we have established that keeping pace with technology is necessary, you may wonder whose responsibility it is to keep current? The answer to this question varies depending on the size and structure of an organization.  

In a small operation, it is not uncommon to have a single person serve as the company technologist. This person will usually be the technology enthusiast that manages all aspects of research and development, design, implementation, and that fixes the system when something goes wrong. This works great for smaller organizations with relatively uncomplicated systems, but as the size of an organization increases, the ability of one person to keep up with all the moving parts becomes increasingly difficult. 

In larger enterprises the responsibility may rest with entire staffs that report to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or a Chief Technology Officer (CTO). While it would be nice to point to one person, or one group, and say, “that is the individual that keeps us current”, the reality is that the onus rests on everyone in the organization.  
  
### What can be done? ###

According to Amitra Sareen-Tak (2016), a survey of Chief Executive Officers (CEO) found that one of the “two main threats to companies in the digital transformation era is the lack of employees that can keep up with the accelerating pace of technological change.” 

Haunschmied, et al, point out that the ability for an organization to keep up with changes in technology is directly impacted by the level of technical savvy that it has on hand (2005). This means that the people assigned to conduct research must be conversant in the specific area of interest. In order to stay relevant, companies will have to invest in existing staff (through training), or outsource. Either way, somebody has to keep the organization technologically current in order to keep up with our customers’ expectations.
