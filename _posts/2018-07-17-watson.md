Tonight I attended a ["Data Analysis Meetup"](https://www.meetup.com/BDU-WashingtonDC/events/251906773/) in D.C. because they were talking about building chatbots using IBM Watson. I didn't really have time to drive down to D.C., so I almost didn't go, but at the last second I noticed that they were going to broadcast the event on the web - so I signed up. 

It was pretty interesting. Setup for Watson is not difficult at all; it's just a matter of getting your logic in place and cobbling the pieces together to handle different situations. I'm thinking that I'll explore other natural language processing capabilities (like AWS Lex, or others).  

All that said, I have absolutely no need for a chatbot on my dinky little site, but what the hey?
