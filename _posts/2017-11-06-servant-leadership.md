## Abstract ##

The concept of servant leadership has garnered much attention of late. First coined by Robert Greenleaf in his essay, The Servant As Leader (1970), the term “servant leader” has recently been cited as the cure for a wide range of management and organizational dysfunctions. It is possible that this newfound interest is due in part to its relationship with another emergent practice; Agile project management from the technology sector. 
Though ill defined, servant leadership is not new. In fact, evidence of its practice by highly-visible and widely-known leaders can be found in contemporary, historical, and religious documentation from around the world (e.g., Dr. Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Jesus of Nazareth and Confucius to name a few). Yet, though it has significant historical context, an exact definition of servant leadership remains illusive. 
In this paper, we explore the effects of the application of servant leadership by reviewing a case study of its use in three high-performing Catholic Church parishes located in the United States, and contrasting leadership activities with the results that they had on their constituency. 
  
## Research Questions ##

By exploring the outcome of the selected case study, this paper aims to pose the following research questions and attempts to discern answers for them, or proffer recommendations for future research: 
- What is servant leadership? 
- What impact can servant leadership have in a public sector organization? 
- What methods can be used to teach or train leaders in the use of servant leadership? 
  
## What Is Servant Leadership?  ##

In The Servant As Leader, Greenleaf surmises that the servant leader as an individual whose predisposition is that of a servant first, and upon whom the role of leader is subsequently imposed. He then contrasts this to the more traditional leader, who typically falls into the role of leader in pursuit of the attainment of power or material wealth. 
The disparity between these two leadership styles is self-evident; the former is revolves around the betterment of others where management is achieved largely under the guise of influence, whereas the latter is concerned with the application of management in order to acquire personal benefit (such as power, prestige, or monetary gain). 
Larry Spears advanced the definition somewhat when he expanded on Greenleaf’s original work to include the top ten characteristics of servant leaders (Spears, 2000). These characteristics are: listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and building community.
More recently, a study from the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, defines servant leadership as “a multidimensional leadership theory that starts with a desire to serve, followed by an intent to lead and develop others, to ultimately achieve a higher purpose objective to the benefit of individuals, organisations [sic], and societies” (Coetzer, Bussin, & Geldenhuys, 2017).
  
## How Do You Make A Servant Leader? ##

Over the course of the last two decades there has been a marked uptick in the interest surrounding the potential that servant leadership can bring to bare. There are numerous examples of companies that have successfully implemented some form of servant leadership and, of course, ultimately benefited from doing so. The internet is chock full of examples, including: Chick-fil-A, Home Depot, the Container Store, Popeyes, Whole Foods, Southwest Airlines, and a multitude of others. 
The evidence is clear; servant leadership works. But, if servant leadership is the answer to everything that ails you, then why isn’t everybody doing it? Why aren’t more company’s and organizations taking heed of the hype and filling their key leadership positions with people that are willing to serve others first?
It isn’t happening everywhere because it’s not easy. In fact, it’s more than that. Not only is it not easy, but it is downright hard and it takes a special kind of person to get it right in the first place. It takes someone that naturally embodies the principles defined by Greenleaf and the ten characteristics identified by Spears.  
These are reflective of the building blocks that make up an individual’s persona. They aren’t lessons that you learn at a leadership symposium or a course at your community college. Angie Morgan and Courtney Lynch describe how they learned the principles of service-based leadership — the U.S. Marine Corps’ version of servant leadership — while serving in the armed forces (Morgan & Lynch, 2017). Considering the fact that the average time in service for a Marine Captain is around seven years, we can surmise that the authors had plenty of time to master the basics of service-based leadership. 
Most companies can’t wait for seven years while leaders develop the skills they need to lead. Some organizations opt to invest in their leaders more proactively. Ed Chacksfield describes how the Kier Group developed a training and development program that teaches leaders to support, enable, and promote the interests of others before themselves. Initially launched in 2012, Kier recognizes the impact that ongoing training and development of employees at all levels has on their bottom line and continues the investment today. 
No matter the approach, it quickly becomes obvious that servant leadership is not a style or technique that can be taught in the short term. Rather it's a way of behaving that evolves over a longer term of continuous exposure and emersion.
  
## Case Study - Introduction ##

Conducted in 2010 by Dan Ebener and David O’Connell from St. Ambrose University, Davenport, Iowa, this case study (entitled “How Might ServantLeadership Work?”) focuses on three Catholic church parishes in Iowa in an effort to examine the effects that the application of servant leadership in their organizations had on the overall parish communities. It has a belief-based slant that is befitting of the public-facing role that religious institutions play in society. 
The results of this case study offers insights to potential results in other public-facing organizations and offers suggestions that will enable aspiring servant leaders to be more effective in their own pursuits. 
  
## Case Study - Leaders' Perspective ##

The study begins with an overview of the current literature, focusing on the seminal work done by Greenleaf and Spears, and then comparing and contrasting differences between the theories embodied in Servant Leadership and Command-and-Control Leadership practices. 
First, the authors focused on three behavioral categories of the leaders in the parishes, these included: 
- Recognizing - the acknowledgment of their followers’ skills and abilities
- Serving - assisting followers in dealing with problems, and 
- Empowering - enabling followers to act on behalf of the organization.
The use of empowerment strategies (i.e., giving followers the ability to make decisions at lower levels that impact outcomes) such as provide lasting benefits to the organization by delegating the authority for decision making and sharing the responsibility of leadership amongst a broader base. Additionally, management benefits from the enhanced buy-in that is recognized by the follower base when they are involved as part of the leadership process through empowerment. 
   
## Case Study - Followers' Perspective ##

Next, the authors focused on four reciprocal behavioral categories that they expected to see from the followers, including: 
- Helping - the altruistic ways that followers reach out to lend a hand to each other
- Initiating - the voluntary action of followers to complete activities or generate new ideas  
- Participating - engagement of followers in the formal activities of the organization, and 
- Self-developing - self-initiated development that advances the ability of the organization.
In all three parishes, the expected behaviors were realized to a much greater extent than could be found in parishes where servant leadership was not employed, indicating that followers are more likely to reciprocate when engaged by parish leaders. 
  
## Case Study - Linking Mechanisms ##

The authors note the existence of linkages between the behavioral categories of the leaders, and the reciprocal behaviors of those that are led. These linking mechanisms were deemed ‘direct’ due to the fact that the leaders called upon followers in an outright manner: 
- Invitation - when leaders asked followers to take action on behalf of the parish
- Inspiration - through their example, leaders inspired followers to devote time and effort to the overall benefit of the parish
- Affection - leaders demonstrated their affection through the care and support the gave to members of the parish
They also noted two types of indirect linkages that took place without direct interaction between the leaders and followers. These mechanisms appear to be prevalent even when the leaders were not present:
- Culture of service - cultural norms that evolved over time as a result of the way that the leader conducted themselves on a recurring basis
- Structural mechanisms - self-sufficient systems that evolved as a result of the leader’s influence

## Case Study - Conclusion ##

The study closes with an overview of servant leaders that will opt to serve rather than be served, to recognize others rather than be recognized themselves, and to empower their followers rather than try to control their responses. By devoting themselves to the service of those that follow them, they create an environment that encourages greater participation at every level of the organization — this shift in behaviors is the true goal of servant leadership. 
  
## Summary ##

In this paper, I set out to answer a series of questions, based on the review of a case study that was conducted in 2010 at three church parishes in Iowa. The research questions, and their summarized answers, are: 
- What is servant leadership? — A type of leadership exhibited by leaders with a servant mindset, that are willing to devote themselves to providing service to subordinates in order to realize a more effective organization and culture.
- What impact can servant leadership have in a public sector organization? — Servant leaders bring new, potentially untapped capabilities to any organization, even those in the public sector. They do this by expanding the sphere of influence, and enabling a culture of capability and willingness on behalf of the vast majority of organizational members that likely went unrealized before.
- What methods can be used to teach or train leaders in the use of servant leadership? — The path to servant leadership is not easy. It requires individuals with established personality traits that are selfless and visionary, and takes dedication and devotion on behalf of the individual and/or the organization. 

Servant leadership is a hard road to travel, but the results are addictive. This is the reason for the current hype in management circles - it takes time to develop an organization that can facilitate a servant leadership approach and more time to realize the benefits of this type of organization. But once a company gets a taste of it, they’ll always want more and will be willing to make investments that promise to deliver more.
