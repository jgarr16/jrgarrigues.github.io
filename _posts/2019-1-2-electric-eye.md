Prophetic? Lucky? Either way, they hit the nail on the head with what we see today. Check the lyrics...

Up here in space<br>
I'm looking down on you<br>
My lasers trace<br>
Everything you do<br>
You think you've private lives<br>
Think nothing of the kind<br>
There is no true escape<br>
I'm watching all the time<br>
I'm made of metal<br>
My circuits gleam<br>
I am perpetual<br>
I keep the country clean<br>
I'm elected electric spy<br>
I'm protected electric eye<br>
Always in focus<br>
You can't feel my stare<br>
I zoom into you<br>
You don't know I'm there<br>
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves<br>
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove<br>
I'm made of metal<br>
My circuits gleam<br>
I am perpetual<br>
I keep the country clean<br>
Electric eye, in the sky<br>
Feel my stare, always there<br>
There's nothing you can do about it<br>
Develop and expose<br>
I feed upon your every thought<br>
And so my power grows<br>
I'm made of metal<br>
My circuits gleam<br>
I am perpetual<br>
I keep the country clean<br>
Protected. Detective. Electric eye<br>
