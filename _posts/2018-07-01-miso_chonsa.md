!["Chonsa & Miso"](/images/1004_miso.jpeg)

Today marks the first week that our little partners have lived with us. Chonsa (left) and Miso (right) have dominated our quiet home. They're an adorable pair of curious little creatures with more energy that either of us remember. Our living room floor quickly filled up with toys and other implements to keep them entertained. Now that they're learning how to carry things, the playground is migrating to every corner of their constantly-expanding empire (it won't be long before we start moving our human stuff to the garage!). I guess this is the same path that families with little humans follow as their young ones grow up. 

A bit on the names:

Miso means 'smile' or 'smiling' in Korean. Chonsa means 'angel' (it also happens to be a combination of numbers, chon = 1,000 and sa = 4, so when these two are combined, 1,004 takes on a special significance in pop culture). Together, Miso Chonsa means 'smiling angel' - the jury is still out on whether that is an accurate portrayal of these two, but so far, we like it.
