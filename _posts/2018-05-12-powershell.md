It has been known by various names over the years - dos prompt, command line, cmd... - but now it's called Powershell. Though I prefer to work in the nix environments, I don't always get a choice when I need to do something on the command line at work. So, Powershell it is. 
While its names have changed, its looks haven't. At least, not on the face of things.

Powershell's out-of-the-box appearance isn't much different from the original; black background, white text, plain Jane. The saving grace is that you can modify its appearance to your personal preferences; that's what we're going to do here.
