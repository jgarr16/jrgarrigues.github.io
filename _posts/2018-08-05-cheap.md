!["Home-grown iPhone screen capture"](/images/iphone.gif)

Yesterday I watched a YouTube how-to clip about the [Ethos crypto wallet](https://www.ethos.io) because it wasn't quite working the way I expected it to. The video showed how the host used the Ethos app on his iPhone as part of the presentation. It wasn't earth-shattering - I'm sure we've all seen iPhone screen captures on the news and around the internet - but it was pretty cool to actually see somebody working through a process on their phone.  

This morning, while browsing through a software catalog, I caught a glimpse of a product that does exactly what, I assume, the YouTuber did for his piece on Ethos. Even better, it was on sale! This is it! I mean, who doesn't need a piece of software that allows them to interact with their iPhone and capture crisp, clean videos of the entire process? What a score; I need this no...

Wait a minute. 

Didn't I read something about screen captures on iOS in an article about one of the recent releases? Wasn't somebody making a big deal about it? And, more importantly, is there a CHEAPER way to do this - like, something that's already built into the operating system? 

Yes, yes, and yes. Turns out that Apple built this feature in on iOS 11 - you can find details [on the Apple Support site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935). Of course I had to try it, so I enabled the screen capture feature on the nearest iPhone (which wasn't mine, by-the-way) and did a quick edit with Camtasia on my Mac (basic edit features are also available using the Quicktime Player that ships with MacOS, so there's another freebie!). 

I was ___outraged___ that said software company would try to make a profit off of something that comes packaged with every iOS device. Okay, "outraged" might be a bit dramatic, but it did make me think about how much of the commercial software industry is based on products that are essentially available gratis somewhere else. I've seen open source software bundled in commercial offerings, so no surprise there, but my question is really about how little somebody can include in a product and still make a decent profit? It's an interesting thought, and it just might prove to be a business model that's been around a lot longer than any of us would suspect...
