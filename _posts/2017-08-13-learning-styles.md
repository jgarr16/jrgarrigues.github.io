excerpt: Discussion about popular methods of learning technology.

I've been trying to figure out what the best way to learn technology is for me. There are several popular methods - I've tried a few and am starting to formulate some opinions. 

- For the stout-hearted (i.e., the glutons for punishment), you can pick up a book and go it alone. I've got a lot of books! Truth be told, I haven't read most of them... 
 
- There are bootcamps for people that want to get maximum immersion in the shortest time possible. I haven't done an actual bootcamp, but I've attended week-long courses on specific tech topics - close. 

- We've got [Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) from places like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [EdX](https://www.edx.org/), etc. I've tried some from each; my current preference is Coursera. 

- Then, finally, there are micro-courses from places like [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/) and [EnvatoTuts+](https://tutsplus.com/) where you can dive in on a specific topic. 


Focus on objective - what do you want to teach most? Coding excellence, or teamwork?

What would I want in a developer?
What is the most valuable?

How does that tie in to what I'd like to see in a classroom environment?

There are big differences in the various training formats that are available to us today. Some people like the deep-immersion style offered by the typical degree-granting universities and the MOOC-style offerings.

Degrees are more slow-moving, cumbersome even. It takes a long time to get them up and going, and during the process, you can end up with sub-minimal instructors that get baked into the system along the way.

Compare and contrast that to your typical week-long session at an IT training type facility. I think that these tend to do a little better than universities because there is a more obvious customer demand (and the repercussions that ensue when you don’t meet the customer’s needs). This is where the free market starts kicking in.

No, finally, compare both of them to MOOCs. This is free-market at its finest. People will start and stop MOOCs on the fly, in real time even. Barriers to usage are extremely low. As a result, people vote with their feet - if the class isn’t helpful, or is boring, they’ll drop the MOOC in a heartbeat. The end result is that those that rise to the top tend to be the better, more capable instructors (like Charles Severance from the University of Michigan).
