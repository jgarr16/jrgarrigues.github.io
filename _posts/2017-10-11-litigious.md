title: "49&#162; Delimma"
excerpt: Too often in our litigious society, good intentions get bogged down by legalese. Maybe somebody can do something about it (or maybe it's all just so much puffery).

This morning I spied an [article](http://www.nextgov.com/defense/2017/10/defense-contractors-could-face-pay-back-clause-losing-bid-protests/141675/?oref=nextgov_today_nl) in one of the Washington, D.C. government-focused magazines that captured my imagination. In it, the author claims that Congress is considering the possibility of holding government vendors/contractors responsible for filing unnecessary lawsuits when they lose a bid on government work. 

--pause for effect--

Just in case you didn't catch it the first time, I said they want to "hold people accountable!" What? That's just [cra-cra](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cra%20cra)! 

A few years ago I was talking with a colleague about a rumored protest filed by a very large company that provided support services to government agencies in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. area. It seems that the company in question was unsuccessful in their bid to continue providing services to the government. Apparently, they were incumbents from a prior contract and felt that since they'd held the job in the past that they were the obvious choice to keep doing so in the future. But the people that manage contracts for the government (called Contracting Officers) deemed otherwise and awarded the contract to someone else - so, they sued! 

And who can blame them? After all, we're talking big money. These contracts can run for many years, resulting in tens, or hundreds, of millions of dollars in profit. Compare that to the downside of 49&#162; - [the cost of a first-class USPS stamp](https://www.usps.com/business/prices.htm). 

Of course they protested; there was no reason not to. The upside was that they might get the award overturned and might be able to keep that money coming in. The downside was that their case could be found to be without merit by the courts and thrown out. It's kind of like playing the lottery - you know you aren't going to win every time you play a $1 ticket, but you also know that you definitely won't win if you don't play at all!!!

But now, that might change. The proposal on the table stipulates that companies that file frivolous cases will have to reimburse the government for costs incurred. That means that they'll pay a little more than 49&#162;, but when you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, will it be enough to deter unnecessary litigation?
