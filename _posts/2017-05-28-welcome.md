Hi there, and welcome to the blog section of my site. There's not much here just yet, but someday you'll find tons of wisdom in these pages. Okay, that's probably a bit of a stretch - maybe I'll touch on a topic that piques your interest (maybe!). Until then, I plan to post on topics such as:

- The tools and techniques I am using for development.
- Things that have made a difference for me and helped me to get things done.
- Ideas that I'd like to work out in the future; be they software projects, process improvements, etc.
