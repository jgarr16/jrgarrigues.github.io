I ran across a picture of yours truly from the mid-to-late 1980s that reminded me of days gone by. It reminded me of a time when things were simpler, at least for me. Not better, just simpler! 

You'll notice the helmet-art on my flight helmet. While a step down from the nose-art of prior soldiers, the crafting of designs and logos on one's flight gear was a passion for some. Mine was a bastardization of the marketing icon for my then favorite rock band, Van Halen. Back then we were allowed to be creative and expressive with certain aspects of our working uniforms. Those that went before us had even more freedoms and were allowed to display symbols on their aircraft (actually we still did that to some degree depending on where in the world we were serving at the time), but we were restricted a bit more in our marketing efforts. Looking back, we were lucky to have that little bit of freedom of expression; I don't think there is any personalization for today's troops.

Apparently, I had time on my hands back then because I made another copy of my little symbol for my car, as seen in this picture on [Tantalus Drive](https://www.tripsavvy.com/driving-tour-of-mount-tantalus-1533794), in Hawaii.
