This one is driving me nuts! Up until yesterday, my MacBook Pro worked just fine with my Apple Watch - I walk up, touch the keyboard or trackpad, Mac unlocks and I get to work. No worries! Yesterday something changed and now my watch won't unlock my laptop. 

I've tried everything in the [Apple Support post](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206995), including repairing my phone/watch, re-establishing two-factor authentication (2FA), and rebooting my laptop, iphone, and watch. All to no avail. The only thing I can think of that might play into this is that I was setting up a personal VPN on my home router last night, but I've turned that off as part of my trouble-shooting (and couldn't replicate the issue). 

I'll keep plugging away, because this is annoying (and very time-consuming!).
