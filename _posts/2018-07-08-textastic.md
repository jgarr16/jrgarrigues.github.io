I vaguely remember buying ["Textastic"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-7/id1049254261?mt=8), an iOS app for editing text, code, and markup on Apple devices, but it was a while ago. I don't recall using it very much, nor why I actually bought it, but assume that I planned to use it to write Python. 

Yesterday, it caught my attention when I was updating apps from the App Store. As I skimmed the description, I noticed that it said "SSH terminal connections..." as one of the recent inclusions for this release. So, I opened the app and tried it out. Voila! Amazingly, I can SSH into my CentOS box and write code, execute Python, etc., etc. 

I know it's geeky, but how cool is that? The power of Linux on an iPad or iPhone! (Per se)
