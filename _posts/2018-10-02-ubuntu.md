Up to this point, I've been rather narrowly focusing on CentOS as far as Linux systems, but I decided to branch out a bit and try some different distributions to see if I've been missing anything. My first stab is with Ubuntu. 

I started with a basic install from a USB thumb drive following a really well done [tutorial](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#0) I found on the Ubuntu site. 

One of the things I didn't like about CentOS was how the [virtual console](https://www.computerbeginnersguides.com/blog/2014/04/16/use-virtual-consoles-in-ubuntu-14-04/) environment worked. I know that I'll want to use virtual consoles when I start writing code, so this was one of the first things I started playing with. Initially everything worked fine. I liked that I was able to bounce between the GUI and the VCs using keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> through <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd>, but I ran into some weird-isms with the display output - an overscanning issue caused somewhere between the operating system, my laptop docking station, and my external monitor. 

Of course, I started tweaking things and quickly found myself in an unrecoverable position in which I couldn't tell whether the shortcuts were supposed to work or not... So, I gave it a shower (reformatted and reinstalled!). 

A little light reading led me to the conclusion that I'm not the only one that has bumped into this issue. Others have encountered (and complained about) the same things. One of the posts suggested that the problem stems from the display manager used by Ubuntu. Turns out that they'd recently moved to the Gnome display manager (GDM) and that there were other options available. I took their advice and figured out how to install a different display manager: 
`sudo apt install lightdm` 
and then configure it for use:
`sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm`
I like the new DM a lot better; it flows easily and quickly, and it even looks a little better on the screen.
