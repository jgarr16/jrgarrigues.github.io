Up to this point, I've been rather narrowly focusing on CentOS as far as Linux systems, but I decided to branch out a bit and try some different distributions to see if I've been missing anything. My first stab is with Ubuntu. 

I started with a basic install from a USB thumb drive following a really well done [tutorial](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#0) I found on the Ubuntu site. 

One of the things I didn't like about CentOS was how the [virtual console](https://www.computerbeginnersguides.com/blog/2014/04/16/use-virtual-consoles-in-ubuntu-14-04/) environment worked. I know that I'll want to use virtual consoles when I start writing code, so this was one of the first things I started playing with. Initially everything worked fine. I liked that I was able to bounce between the GUI and the VCs using keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> through <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd>, but I ran into some weird-isms with the display output - an overscanning issue caused somewhere between the operating system, my laptop docking station, and my external monitor. 

Of course, I started tweaking things and quickly found myself in an unrecoverable position in which I couldn't tell whether

Research led me to 

`sudo apt install lightdm`

`sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm`
