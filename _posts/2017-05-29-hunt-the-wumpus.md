title: Hunt the Wumpus
---

"Hunt the Wumpus", originally devised by Gregory Yob in the mid-1970s, was an early text-based computer game written in BASIC. It was a simple hide and seek-style game that featured a mysterious monster, the Wumpus, that lurks deep inside a network of rooms. As a result of the availability of its ource code, the game was ported to numerous programming languages and platforms.

My version is written in Python (this one in Python 2.7, but I'll likely upgrade to Python 3.6 at a later date). Though the code found here was all written by me, this is not a completely original idea; the impetus was from Anthony Briggs' “Hello! Python” book, which I got from Manning Books - https://www.manning.com/books/hello-python.

Hunt the Wumpus isn't a terribly exciting game; I mean, it's text-based for crying out loud. It is a lot of fun, however, to come up with ideas for the game and then turn those ideas into rules using code. In fact, it's a little too much fun. I've already skipped way past what the book recommends and have implemented lots of ideas that might cause problems when I get to more advanced sections of the project as they're defined by the book's author. Alas - that's where "refactoring" comes into play (more on that in a future post). 

For the time being, feel free to peruse my Python code on GitHub at https://github.com/jrgarrigues/wumpus

Figure out what works for you and DO IT!
