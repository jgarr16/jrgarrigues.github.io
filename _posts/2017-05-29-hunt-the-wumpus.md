title: "Hunt the Wumpus"
excerpt: Developing a game to learn how to code in Python.

"Hunt the Wumpus" was an early text-based computer game written in BASIC. Originally devised by Gregory Yob in the mid-1970s, it took root in early computer programming circles because of the availability of its source code - as a result, the game was ported to numerous programming languages and platforms. The concept was simple; a hide and seek-style game that featured a mysterious monster, the Wumpus, that lurked deep inside a network of caves and hallways.  

My version is written in Python (this one in Python 2.7, but I'll likely upgrade to Python 3.6 at a later date). Though the code found here was all written by me, this is not a completely original idea; the impetus was from Anthony Briggs' “Hello! Python” book, which I got from Manning Books - <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/hello-python">https://www.manning.com/books/hello-python</a>.

Hunt the Wumpus isn't a terribly exciting game; I mean, it's text-based for crying out loud. It is a lot of fun, however, to come up with ideas for the game and then turn those ideas into rules using code. In fact, it's a little too much fun. I've already skipped way past what the book recommends and have implemented lots of ideas that might cause problems when I get to more advanced sections of the project as they're defined by the book's author. Alas - that's where "refactoring" comes into play (more on that in a future post). 

For the time being, feel free to peruse my Python code on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/jrgarrigues/wumpus">https://github.com/jrgarrigues/wumpus</a>

Figure out what works for you and DO IT!
