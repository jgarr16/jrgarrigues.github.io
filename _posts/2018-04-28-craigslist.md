I fell in love with craigslist back in the early 2000s - it was a cool idea and a great way to find local stuff. If you needed something, chances were that it could be found on craigslist. I remember setting up craigslist to help my mother find a tenant as early as 2004; undoubtedly I was using it before then because I was already proficient at the time. Coolest thing, it just worked. 

Flash forward to today - I've got a piece of furniture that's just sitting here taking up space. It's a nice piece. I like it. But we just don't use it anymore. Wait; I know - craigslist to the rescue... Viva la craigslist! Yayyyyyy!
