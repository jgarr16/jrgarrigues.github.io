!["craigslist"](/images/craigslist.png)

I fell in love with craigslist back in the early 2000s - it was a cool idea and a great way to find local stuff. If you needed something, chances were that it could be found on craigslist. 

(even then everybody knew that it was best to avoid long-distance opportunities)

As I recall, we had a few laughs about the name and whether or not I would get extra credit for being a Garrigues, but damned if I can remember a thing about the class (and I made an A...).
