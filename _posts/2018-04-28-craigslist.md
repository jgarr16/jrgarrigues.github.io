Technology is a dream, isn't it? It's just so damn easy to do everything these days. Open up a computer, bang out a few lines, and - Voila! - it's done. Take craigslist (the online want ads) for example. Used to be, if you wanted to buy or sell something, you took out an ad in your local newspaper and sat back for the long wait. And then came...

I fell in love with craigslist back in the early 2000s - it was a great way to find local stuff and all around cool to boot. If you needed something, chances were that it could be found on craigslist. I remember setting up craigslist to help my mother find a tenant as early as 2004; undoubtedly I was using it before then because I was already proficient at the time. Coolest thing, it just worked. 

Flash forward to today - I've got a piece of furniture that's just sitting here taking up space. It's a nice piece. I like it. But we just don't use it anymore. Wait; I know - craigslist to the rescue... Somebody else will want it, and they can give me a little bit of money in the process. Everybody wins; Viva la craigslist! Yayyyyyy! 

So, I snapped some pics (different topic, but that sure is easy to do these days; isn't it?), drafted up a couple sentences to say that I can't deliver, but I'll help you load it up in your truck, and pulled the trigger. "Your advert has been published!" Now, just sit back and wait for the buyers to repl...

..."I want to buy this object from you. Please send me a text as soon as possible!" Hmmm, something is off on this one. 

..."Text me now so I can send you the money" Okay, these are obviously phishers, but what's up with wanting the texts? 

It seems that the gimics have been taken to another level on craigslist. I don't necessarily expect to be bombarded with offers, but I was a little surprised that the only thing that came in over the weekend was from people that are trying to get personally identifiable information (like my cell phone number) from me. Apparently '[SMiShing](http://fortune.com/2017/07/07/smishing-scam/)' (SMS phishing) is a thing now too.

When I used these services before, the biggest concern was in getting jumped for your cash when you showed up to buy something, but now it's more of an electronic 'winner takes all' approach and the bad guys are out there en masse. Funny thing is that they all have bad english - not as bad as the dudes from Africa that email me to tell me about my long, lost uncle's fortune that I've just inherited, but not a whole lot better either. 

In the long run, I guess that we can do a whole bunch of stuff faster now, but we have to keep in mind that so can everybody else. The scammers are still out there, and they always will be. So, while normal people are taking advantage of technology and saving time in the process, so are the bad guys. Which means that part of the price we pay for expedience is the need for an ever-increasing vigilance. So...
