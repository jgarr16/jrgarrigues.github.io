title: "Let's Talk: Roadmaps"
excerpt: In the past, we used roadmaps to keep us on track when we were travelling long distances. Today, we use roadmaps for project management; to help us stay strategically focused on goals and objectives of major efforts.

They are ubiquitous today, but satellite-based [Global Positioning Systems (GPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) have not always been around to help us pinpoint our exact location and help us get where we're going. Back in the day, when you wanted to go somewhere new, you had to do a little bit of planning and preparation before you jumped in the car. 

First, you needed a destination. Next, you'd whip out your handy-dandy [roadmap](https://store.randmcnally.com/u-s-maps-guides.html) and plot a course - experienced travelers often highlighted the highways in ink for quick reference once they're on the road. If you had time to spare, you might do some research to identify any tourist attractions along the way that warranted brief detours, but if you were in a hurry - pack your bags, load up the kids, fill up the tank, and hit the road.

Once you were driving, you needed to keep a wary eye on the roadmap; making a concerted effort to stay on the highlighted path until you got to your final destination. If something forced you off that path (detours, accidents, roads closed due to inclement weather, you name it...), you'd do whatever it took to get back on course and complete the journey - pull over, look at the map, and find the quickest way to get back on your predetermined course. 

Cumbersome and bulky by today's standards, this proven process was a great time-saver when blended with the technology available at the time. Without it you'd be lost before you got started; as George Harrison said in his 1988 song, [Any Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Road), "if you don't know where you're going, any road'll take you there". 

...but that was then! Technology has come a long way in a relatively short period of time. In recent years we've been presented with an onslaught of technological advances that have dramatically changed the way we travel. Want to take a trip to somewhere you've never been before? 

![There's an app for that!](/images/theres-an-app-for-that.png)

No longer must we while away afternoons and evenings pouring over paper maps and tourist guides to plan our trips. Instead, we simply pull out a smartphone and enter the address of our destination, specify a few options to let your app know that you want to "stay on the highway" or "avoid the highway," hit the 'go' button, and follow the friendly voice of your virtual navigator. 

The tech we use today doesn't just make it easier to plan your route. Oh no, it does a lot more! Your app checks traffic conditions, vectors you around accidents and other bottle-necks, warns you about speed traps, and (most importantly) recalculates routes in real time when your plans change - like when you take that little side trip to see the world's largest ball of yarn! 

In truth, this post didn't start off as a meditation on navigational technologies; it was actually a post about iterative methodologies that we use to plan IT projects. It just so happens that one of the primary ingredients is the use of a "roadmap," which got me thinking... 

The [Project Management Institute's (PMI)](https://www.pmi.org/about/learn-about-pmi/what-is-project-management) definition of a project is *a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result*. Within the scope of project management, roadmaps are high-level artifacts that describe the life cycle of a product over the course of time - they are used as a point of reference to help maintain strategic alignment to the original intent of a project. 

The roadmaps that we use for software development have a lot of similarities to those that we used to describe our family vacation planning above. In the beginning (i.e., in the waterfall world), we devoted a great deal of time to planning and analysis of our projects. This resulted in detailed plans that covered every aspect of a project, often drafted up months or years before we would begin to execute the steps to bring them to fruition. 

Over time, we became more proficient and developed new and better techniques to do our job. Much in the same way that new tech impacted our weekend travels, new project management methodologies (Agile, Scrum, XP, etc.) improved our ability to build world-class software products. And with this modernization, roadmaps gained in significance and importance to the process.  

In the waterfall world, roadmaps tend to be used for high-level discussions during the initiation phase of the life cycle - when an idea is conceptualized and the folks that are championing the effort are trying to garner support in order to authorize an investment. Because they tend to be high-level, once the project is approved and it moves into the serious planning stages, the roadmap tends to get relegated to the marketing shelf where it might occasionally be pulled out and polished up for execs, but otherwise, gathers dust. 

In an Agile world, we change things up a little by maintaining a continual focus on the roadmap as our predominant planning document. This is due in part to the fact that we try to avoid unnecessary planning and documentation on Agile projects - that doesn't mean we don't plan or document, but that we try to keep it to a minimum and only engage in activities that add value to our effort. One way to keep it to a minimum is to get maximum value from all the work we do - and since creating a roadmap is something that we will already have accomplished (you've still got to sell people on the viability of your project in order to get the funding and resources necessary to do the work), we'll leverage that effort and avoid some of the follow-on work that might once have been done on a waterfall project. 

But wait! There's more! 

If we make some minor adjustments to the way we use our roadmap - the document that describes the life cycle of a product over the course of time - we can eliminate a little more of that planning and documentation work by simply keeping the roadmap up to date. 

This makes the roadmap a "living document." Like any other living thing (your kids, pets, plants, etc.), your roadmap needs some [TLC](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender%20loving%20care) to keep it healthy. The good news is that it doesn't take a lot of effort to upkeep; in fact, it's relatively simple. By using the roadmap as the basis for planning sessions when you coordinate the work that your team can do in the next iteration (sprint), and also using it as a marketing artifact with your customers and stakeholders, you'll be sure that you are always focusing your precious resources (people, time, and money) on developing and delivering the most valuable items possible. 

Much the same way the new travel apps on your smartphone give you the ability to re-route your travel itinerary in real-time, your Agile roadmap allows you to be a nimble and flexible product owner, thereby maximizing value across the entire spectrum of project management.
