I've been playing around with Python for a little bit now; still quite the amateur, but I enjoy it as a hobby. Even though it's a hobby, most of the stuff I've done has been for work; parsing and analyzing data from multiple ticketing systems, generating reports, etc. And, even though the stuff I do has mostly been for work, the only time I usually have is after hours, so I find myself developing on a Mac, then porting everything over into the Windows world at the office. 

Python runs like a dog on Windows (*I haven't spent much time optimizing or anything, so that could be my fault*), so I was looking for something to speed things up for me. Eventually I finangled a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual machine to work on and run the scripts that need more juice. The Linux box, while still not a Mac, runs circles around the Windows machine and saves my sanity, if not my time. This left me in a bit of a conundrum as I then found myself coding on Mac at home, then running the code on Linux at the office. Oh-by-the-way... did I mention that I was still running some of the smaller jobs on Windows just because that's where the data was? So, actually, I was coding on Mac for jobs that I was running on Linux AND Windows.

Being somewhat geeky, I wanted to replicate these environments at home so that I could, comfortably, validate new code in as many of the operating systems as possible before I introduced them to my workflow. First I setup Parallels VMs for Windows and Linux on my MacBook Pro. That worked okay, but I wasn't really tickled about having to start up the VM every time I wanted to test something out (even though I'll probably do exactly the same thing with a physical box as time goes by!). Running multiple VMs also bogged down the Mac a little, so I had to find a better way.

I have Windows 10 machines at home, so replicating that part was pretty easy, but I didn't have a Linux machine. Over the weekend I decided to throw something together using an old laptop that had fallen into disuse (long live technology!). I figured that [CentOS](https://www.centos.org) should do the trick since it is an open-source version of RHEL. In fact, CentOS is provided by Red Hat and they keep it in sync with the paid-for RHEL versions - so, what better solution could there be? I went with the minimal install - that's a bare-bones installation that only has command line - since I wasn't using a GUI on my Red Hat machine at the office anyway. Plus, it probably saved me two minutes in download time. Ever efficient I am.

As it turns out, there were a lot of little things that were already built out in the systems at work that I didn't have to waste my time on, but they weren't built out at home. So I had to do a little homework. I ran across an article - [TecMint: 30 Things to Do After Minimal RHEL/CentOS 7 Installation](https://www.tecmint.com/things-to-do-after-minimal-rhel-centos-7-installation/) - that provided some good recommendations to get started. Then there were other things that I started playing with, including: 

- Setting power options so I could close the lid without shutting off the laptop - [instructions](https://www.centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58498)
- Installing/configuring RSYNC for file transfer between the Mac and Linux - [instructions](https://www.garron.me/en/go2linux/rsync-backup-linux-using-rsync-to-backup-files-or-folder-under-linux.html)
- Set up the Red Hat Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository - [instructions](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/installing-rhel-epel-repo-on-centos-redhat-7-x/)
- Installing Python 3 (Python2 comes with the minimal install, but I'm using 3.4 on Linux at work, so...).

Some things I still need to do: 
- Set Wake-On-LAN and power options so the laptop will sleep when not in use, but will be reachable.
- Install Python modules that I'm using elsewhere (e.g., ftfy, urllib, etc.).
