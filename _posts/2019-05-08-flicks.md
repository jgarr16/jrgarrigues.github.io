I recently watched three flicks that all had the same effect on me - that is, they made me tip-toe around the house, careful not to wake anything that lurks in dark corners!

[!["Bird Box"](/images/bird_box.jpg)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2737304/)

Sandra Bullock heads up Bird Box - five years after an ominous unseen presence, which is attracted by any noise that you make, drives people to commit suicide. Sandra and her two children set out on a trek to reach safety. 

[!["A Quiet Place"](/images/quiet_place.jpg)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6644200/)

Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are the parents of a small family that is forced to live in silence while hiding from monsters with ultra-sensitive hearing.

[!["The Silence"](/images/silence.jpg)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7315484/)

Stanley Tucci stars as the patriarch of a faimily that seeks refuge in a remote haven after the world came under attack from terrifying, bird-like creatures who hunt their human prey by sound.
