Moltke on Leadership
Type A - dumb and lazy leaders were given simple, repetitive and unchallenging tasks to perform.

Type B - bright and energetic, were considered to be micromanagers and would, be poor leaders.

Type C - dumb but energetic, were considered to be somewhat dangerous. Officers who would require constant supervision,

Type D - bright but lazy officers who Moltke felt could and should take the highest levels of command. These officers were smart enough to see what needed to be done but were also motivated by inherent laziness to find the easiest, simplest way to achieve what was required. Put in a more positive way, they would know how to be successful through the most efficient deployment of effort.
