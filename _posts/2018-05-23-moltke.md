__Moltke on Leadership__

In the latter 1800s, Helmuth von Moltke was a high ranking general (Chief of Staff at one point) in the Prussian Army. He developed this interesting Value Matrix to categorize his officer corps:

!["Attribute Matrix"](/images/moltke_matrix.jpg)

Type A - dumb and lazy leaders were given simple, repetitive and unchallenging tasks to perform. Leave them alone and maybe they'll do something useful.

Type B - bright and energetic, make intelligent plans that make the right things happen. He made these his general staff officers.

Type C - dumb but energetic, were considered to be somewhat dangerous. Officers who would require constant supervision and should be fired immediately.

Type D - bright but lazy officers who Moltke felt could and should take the highest levels of command. These officers were smart enough to see what needed to be done but were also motivated by inherent laziness to find the easiest, simplest way to achieve what was required. Put in a more positive way, they would know how to be successful through the most efficient deployment of effort.
