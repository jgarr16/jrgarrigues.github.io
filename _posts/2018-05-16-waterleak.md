It started as a hobby! 

Okay, I lie. There's nothing relaxing about chasing water leaks in your home. In fact, it can be downright frustrating. I want to share the things I've learned as I chased a couple leaks in my home so that, maybe, it can save somebody else some grief (or at least let them know that they're not the only people that are having this problem! - comfort in numbers!). 

Our little journey started off on the front side of the house. In our first year of owning the house, we noticed a small puddle on our basement floor after a hard rain. Actually, it was more than one puddle; there were a series of small leaks along the southern basement wall (which corresponds with the front of our house) !["basement floor"](/images/basement_floor.jpg) _Beside the obvious puddle in the foreground, you will alson notice several smaller collections of water identified by the arrows in the picture._

We didn't find water every time it rained, it was somewhat sporadic, but there was a pattern, we just had to let it reveal itself. Eventually we realized that the events that leaks only materialized after we had a hard, driving rain from the South. We got into the habit of running down to the basement every time it rained and we had moisture on the front windows - if the rain came from any other direction there wouldn't be anything on the floor.
