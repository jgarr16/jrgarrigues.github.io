It started as a hobby! 

Okay, I lie. There's nothing relaxing about chasing water leaks in your home. In fact, it can be downright frustrating. I want to share the things I've learned as I chased a couple leaks in my home so that, maybe, it can save somebody else some grief (or at least let them know that they're not the only people that are having this problem - comfort in numbers!). 

Our little journey started off on the front side of the house. In our first year of owning the house, we noticed a small puddle on our basement floor after a hard rain. Actually, it was more than one puddle; there were a series of small leaks along the southern basement wall (which corresponds with the front of our house). !["basement floor"](/images/basement_floor.jpg) _Beside the obvious puddle in the foreground, you can see several smaller collections of water identified by the arrows in the picture._

We didn't find water every time it rained; results were very sporadic, but there was a pattern. We just had to be patient and observant and let the pattern reveal itself. Eventually we realized that leaks only materialized after we had a hard, driving rain from the South. We got into the habit of running down to the basement every time it rained and we had moisture on the front windows - if the rain came from any other direction there wouldn't be anything on the floor. 

At this point, we knew when to expect a puddle, but we weren't much closer to knowing what caused them. So we reached out for "help" - Angie's List to the rescue! We scheduled appointments with a few companies to get an idea of what needed to be done to stop the leaks and how much it would cost. 

Recommendations were all over the map. One consultant suggested that it was a problem with the water tables - that the ground was becoming saturated and reaching a level where the water was pouring over the top of the sill, into our basement. He wanted to dig an elaborate system of [French drains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_drain) in our front yard to keep the water away from the foundation (I can't remember how much he wanted to do that, but it was pretty pricey). 

Another person suggested that the problem lay with the stoop that comprised our front porch - he wanted to replace the stoop and the front sidewalk, laying tubing underneath so that water would weep away from the foundation. There was a similar theme to some of the approaches, which almost made us think that they might be on to something (i.e., almost like it was a result of 'groupthink' and that there might be some semblance of safety in numbers to the approach). 

A third person had a completely different concoction that included boring holes into our concrete basement walls and treating the wooden beams that comprised the sill on top of the concrete. That guy was a wack job - we didn't consider his recommendation for very long.
