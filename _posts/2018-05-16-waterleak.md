It started as a hobby! 

Okay, I lie. There's nothing relaxing about chasing water leaks in your home. In fact, it can be downright frustrating. I want to share the things I've learned as I chased a couple leaks in my home so that, maybe, it can save somebody else some grief (or at least let them know that they're not the only people that are having this problem!). 

Our little journey started off on the front side of the house. In our first year of owning the house, we noticed a small puddle on our basement floor after a hard rain. Actually, it was more than one puddle; there were a series of small leaks along the southern basement wall (which corresponds with the front of our house).

We didn't find water every time it rained; results were very sporadic, but there was a pattern. We just had to be patient and observant and let the pattern reveal itself. Eventually we realized that leaks only materialized after we had a hard, driving rain from the South. We got into the habit of running down to the basement every time it rained and we had moisture on the front windows - if the rain came from any other direction there wouldn't be anything on the floor. 

At this point, we knew when to expect a puddle, but we weren't much closer to knowing what caused them. So we reached out for "help" - Angie's List to the rescue! We scheduled appointments with a few companies to get an idea of what needed to be done to stop the leaks and how much it would cost. 

Recommendations were all over the map. One consultant suggested that it was a problem with the water tables - that the ground was becoming saturated and reaching a level where the water was pouring over the top of the sill, into our basement. He wanted to dig an elaborate system of [French drains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_drain) in our front yard to keep the water away from the foundation (I can't remember how much he wanted to do that, but it was pretty pricey). 

Another person suggested that the problem lay with the stoop that comprised our front porch - he wanted to replace the stoop and the front sidewalk, laying tubing underneath so that water would weep away from the foundation.  

A third person had a completely different concoction that included boring holes into our concrete basement walls and treating the wooden beams that comprised the sill on top of the concrete. That guy was a wack job - we didn't consider his recommendation for very long. 

The first two recommendations had similar themes, which almost made us think that they might be on to something (i.e., almost like it was a result of 'groupthink' and that there might be some semblance of safety in numbers to the approach). Effectively, these people were saying that if we kept the water away from the house, our problem would be resolved. It was tempting to believe, but there was still a problem with what they were saying. Their approaches did not FIX our problem, instead they just AVOIDED it. What's to say that if we didn't fix the issue it wouldn't return in another form or fashion to haunt us again in a different way? (I didn't have enough imagination to figure out what the different way was - maybe, instead of water coming into the basement, ants or other bugs would start to use the little holes to come in and freak out my wife!) 

So, we kept thinking... 

One of the things that didn't quite add up to the saturated ground & wicking theory that the first two were pushing was heighth. We did some rudimentary measurements as part of our initial discovery, before we called contractors. It was difficult to tell exactly where the ceiling of the basement lined up with the ground outside - was the ground __above__ the level of the ceiling (or, more importantly, the sill on top of the concrete wall)? There was a water spicket on the outside of the front wall that we used to estimate the heighth, but it was too close to know for sure. That said, it seemed like the ground level was below, or just at, the level of the sill. If it was below, then the saturation theory didn't hold water (pun intended) because the water from outside the house would have to travel upward to get over the concrete and then flow down the side of the concrete wall in order to form a puddle on the floor.
