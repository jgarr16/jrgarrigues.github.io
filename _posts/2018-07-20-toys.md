!["Chonsa with her toys"](/images/toys.jpg)

I've always puzzled about why people buy so many toys for their kids. I mean, seriously, how many does a kid need? And what compels parents to keep buying more? There's got to be a limit where you know, with some certainty, that the addition of another toy is not going to garner your child any more joy, nor you any more love from your child. The limit might be different for every parent/guardian/provider, and the perception is likely different for each recipient, but there remains a limit. 

Then, we got kitties. Boy do they have a lot of toys...
