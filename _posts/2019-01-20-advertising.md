I raced into the grocery store the other day; cold weather, fussing with gloves, AirPods blasting music... A few steps after I grabbed my cart I thought "that's an odd thing to say" and had to look down at the advert to see what was amiss. Outside, in the cold, at a quick glance, my brain deciphered an entirely different message. One that went something like, 

__We are _NOT_ proud of what's in our food!__

Upon actually reading the sign I immediately knew what had happened, but guess which message is still ringing around between my ears? _(Hint: it's not the one that the marketers intended!)_
