Twenty-seven months ago we bought a treadmill and put it in the basement to collect dust because everybody knows that's what treadmills are for! This morning, when I stumbled downstairs and strapped on my dustmop, I realized that we were just about to breach the 2,000 mile mark. In fact, we were so close that my normal little jog was going to put us over the line; so I ran upstairs and grabbed my phone so I could memorialize the moment because the other thing we do is take pictures of everything, everywhere!
