Twenty-seven months ago we bought a treadmill and put it in the basement to collect dust because everybody knows that's what treadmills are for! This morning, when I stumbled downstairs and strapped on my dustmop, I realized that we were just about to breach the 2,000 mile mark. In fact, we were so close that my normal little jog was going to put us over the line; so I ran upstairs and grabbed my phone so I could memorialize the moment because the other thing we do is take pictures of everything, everywhere! 

I was feeling pretty good about myself after I exercised. "Yes! We paid a bunch of money for our exercise equipment, and we've actually made use of it! No waste here; keep moving folks! Score one for the good guys."

Enter iPad... That's where things started going south. So, where would I be if my walk/jog/(sometimes)run sessions over the past twenty-seven months were outside the confines of my basement. I already knew that Austin is about 1,500 miles away, so I'd have to look elsewhere - I know, San Diego, my other favorite haunt. Looks like I'd be passing through Gallup, NM this morning. 

That's all good, but then I noticed that if I was walking from Baltimore it would only take me 27 DAYS to get to Gallup. Not twenty-seven MONTHS! Suddenly I'm twenty-six months in arrears and my victory wasn't quite as glamorous. But then again, at least I don't have a layer of two-year old dust on my treadmill!
