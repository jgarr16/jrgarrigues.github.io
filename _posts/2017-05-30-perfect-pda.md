I've struggled with organization for a long time. Don't get me wrong, by most peoples' standards, I think I'd be considered 'quite organized' - I get a lot done and done well. But that's not what I'm talking about... 

Years ago, as I climbed the ranks of government service, I noticed that the people I admired all seemed to have a system. For some it was a favorite [Moleskine notebook](http://www.moleskine.com/us/), for others it was [Microsoft OneNote](http://www.onenote.com). Whatever it was, they all had a process that kept them on top of the things they needed to get done in a prioritized, systemic manner. By comparison, I always felt like I was flailing around on the sidelines, never really taking full advantage of resources and maximizing my impact. 

As I plug through Python tutorials and read through guide books and online forums, I am forming some ideas on what *my* system might start to look like. It needs to be adaptive and pervasive in presence, while not getting in my way at the same time. It should help me prioritize items on large and small scales, and then it must be able to track my progress toward my priorities with minimal input from me (or just enough to keep things going anyway). 

I guess, the thing is that it has to be highly personalized to do the things that I want it to do. This isn't something you pull off a shelf, open the shrinkwrap, and unleash on the world. Instead, it has to be bespoke; custom-built in a by-me-for-me way if it's going to be helpful. (And, yes, I recognize that BMFM is probably not a cool acronym!) 

So, I need to attack this with an Agile mindset. As I work on my Wumpus game and learn the ins & outs of Python, I'll have this idea in the back of my mind and will begin to formulate an approach to build and implement the various little pieces of my organizational system. Then, as befits a modular approach, I'll start cobbling the pieces together until it takes shape and begins to resemble my [perfect PDA](http://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2004/03/06).
