Back in the Spring 2002 semester, I took a course in Sociology. My professor was [Stephen Garrigues](https://koreatesol.org/content/20150418-dr-steve-garrigues) (no relation, to the best of my knowledge!). As I recall, we had a few laughs about the name and whether or not I would get extra credit for being a Garrigues, but damned if I can remember a thing about the class (and I made an A...).
