I ran across an increcible short story that touches on the importance of the rapid pace of technological advancements across society today. Titled, The Machine Stops, this story was penned by E. M. Forster in 1909. It is a fascinating study on the potential impact that technology could impose upon humanity - and it was written more than 100 years ago! If you read it, think about the ways that the Internet has shaped our society over the course of the last twenty years, or how much influence the use of facebook, Twitter, email, and so many other social media applications have on your personal and professional lives - it really is amazingly predictive; and written so long ago!
