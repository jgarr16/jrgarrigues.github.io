I've been studying a MOOC programming course entitled [Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) from Coursera for the past month or so. There was a hiccup a few weeks ago that caused me to loose access to the course, so I took a break while it was getting sorted out. The problem has been cleared up, and now I'm back at hacking away in a guided manner!

I realy do like the course; it's basic enough to not scare me away with a bunch of terms and definitions that I can't understand, while at the same time being detailed enough to keep my interest. I wrapped up the second course (there are four courses and a capstone project for the whole thing) over the weekend and now I'm working my way through the third. 

Tonight I did a chapter on [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) - or regex. You've got to love regexes! I remember trying to understand them in my undergrad studies - *oooouffffff*! The Coursera instructor, Dr. Chuck, did a real good job and this time around, I got it. 

Back for more later.
