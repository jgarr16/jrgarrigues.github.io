I use Airmail 3 for email on my Mac and iOS devices. I primarily enjoy the ability to use markdown for my messages, but there are other features that I like as well, including managing multiple email accounts (and their aliases), integration with [SpamSieve](https://c-command.com/spamsieve/), and default blocking of images and files to name a few. 

For the most part, I like the product, but there are some quirks that drive me crazy about Airmail 3. One in particular is how it decides which email account to use when I reply to messages. Out of the box, the application seems to want to use a single account when sending replies. 

For example, my primary email account is from Yahoo; let's call it primary@yahoo.com. Within Yahoo I have established aliases for my primary account: alias1@yahoo.com, alias2@yahoo.com, and alias3@yahoo.com. These aliases are setup to serve specific needs, such as communicating with service providers from Angie's List, signing up for user forums and listserves, and staying in touch with my family. I receive email separately to each of these aliases and the all show up in my Airmail 3 inbox. I use different signatures for each of these aliases, with different information depending upon the purpose of the alias.

So, when I receive an email to alias1@yahoo.com and I select "reply", it defaults to the account and signature for primary@yahoo.com. I can force it to be sent out by the alias account, but I have to be paying attention and remember to click the dropdown at the top of my reply before I hit the __GO__ button. If I'm in a hurry (_which I usually am_), and I forget to check the __From:__ block (_which I do, repeatedly_), the message goes out from the wrong email address and defeats the purpose of having an alias in the first place. Even worse, this weirdism isn't restricted to primary/alias accounts; it also happens when I send from completely different email accounts like Gmail.

This is undoubtedly a configuration issue and I'm sure it's something that can be solved, but my fleeting attempts in the past didn't resolve the problem, so I just dealt with it for a long time. Alas, no more; I finally reached a tipping point when I inadvertently sent an email from the wrong address to a group of inquisitive folks that noticed - ___now it's time to fix this!___

Found this post about using embedded code to share pictures from a Google Drive. I want to write some Python to automate the process and make images shareable on the fly...
