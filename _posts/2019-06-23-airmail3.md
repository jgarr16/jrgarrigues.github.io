I use Airmail 3 for email on my Mac and iOS devices. I primarily enjoy the ability to use markdown for my messages, but there are other features that I like as well, including managing multiple email accounts (and their aliases), integration with [SpamSieve](https://c-command.com/spamsieve/), and default blocking of images and files to name a few. 

For the most part, I like the product, but there are some quirks that drive me crazy about Airmail 3. One in particular is how it decides which email account to use when I reply to messages. Out of the box, the application seems to want to use a single account when sending replies. 

For example, my primary email account is from Yahoo; let's call it primary@yahoo.com. Within Yahoo I have established aliases for my primary account: alias1@yahoo.com, alias2@yahoo.com, and alias3@yahoo.com. These aliases are setup to serve specific needs, such as communicating with service providers from Angie's List, signing up for user forums and listserves, and staying in touch with my family. I receive email separately to each of these aliases and the all show up in my Airmail 3 inbox. I use different signatures for each of these aliases, with different information depending upon the purpose of the alias.

So, when I receive an email to alias1@yahoo.com and I select "reply", it defaults to the account and signature for primary@yahoo.com. I can force it to be sent out by the alias account, but I have to be paying attention and remember to click the dropdown at the top of my reply before I hit the __GO__ button. If I'm in a hurry (_which I usually am_), and I forget to check the __From:__ block (_which I do, repeatedly_), the message goes out from the wrong email address and defeats the purpose of having an alias in the first place. Even worse, this weirdism isn't restricted to primary/alias accounts; it also happens when I send from completely different email accounts like Gmail.

This is undoubtedly a configuration issue and I'm sure it's something that can be solved, but my fleeting attempts in the past didn't resolve the problem, so I just dealt with it for a long time. Alas, no more; I finally reached a tipping point when I inadvertently sent an email from the wrong address to a group of inquisitive folks that noticed - ___now it's time to fix this!___

First things first; you need to have aliases established with your email provider. [Yahoo](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN29287.html) let's you do it; I'm sure it's a common feature with most of the big email providers. Once you've got an established alias, you need to setup Airmail 3 to use them - basic instructions can be found in the following [Airmail Tutorial](https://help.airmailapp.com/en-us/article/alias-account-tutorial-airmail-for-macos-1nl831w/). __Note:__ I had my account setup in accordance with these instructions, but I still encountered the issues outlined above, so there is obviously a little more to the setup (_or I made a change along the way that I've since forgotten about! Definitely possible!_).

So, just to be safe, once you have the alias account setup in Airmail 3, pop back into the  Preferences/Accounts/Primary_Email_Settings/Alias page shown here:

...and double-click the appropriate alias to get into its configuration page:

Make sure that the __Default Replier:__ dropdown selector is set to "_Always reply with this_." (_Mine was unchecked when I started digging, and I'm pretty sure this was the root of my problem._) Just for good measure, you might also want to make sure that the __Default Sender__ checkbox is unchecked while you're in here. 

Next, back out fo the Alias Configuration area and head over to the Preferences/Accounts/Primary_Email_Settings/Composer page:

<img src="https://e4jdpw.dm.files.1drv.com/y4m8YSOa4vnytHtbdylFobEKnMXTvuqz5CEMU_J-vASYFMrYBO_dP19Fnzh70h3A35JTilSzWMU1SFzd6LAPF6udp_pJh-wM7gbrf-wGcX6ZF3gv65nto8oUfI7DDRdNMfwE6BjlqHBXQnqiqe4WuyKvp9cK5Qa9ujxMIKm4kwC9r93BucLaBu_ZumMad-9vzaTZaFLtMRwhx92735ciI8nJw?width=600&height=558&cropmode=none" width="600" height="558" />

Here you'll want to uncheck the __Default Replier (Ignore Alias)__ checkbox if it's checked. (_Again, mine was checked._) 

There's really no telling how much of this was my own doing. I've poked around in the Airmail 3 settings quite a bit in the past, but there's plenty of adjustments that can be made, and I'm not really the best at reading instructions for personal stuff, so who knows? Hope this helps somebody in some little way.

Selah!
