I like new stuff; software and operating systems included! I've always been eager to have the latest version of a system working on whichever device I am using at the time; to the point that I frequently run beta software to see what's coming next and help identify inconsistencies when I can. Bottom line: I think that technology is cool, but new tech is the cats' meow!

Thus, a couple months ago, I installed the newest Mac operating system, High Sierra, on my mid-2015 MacBook Pro. I was immediately confronted with an issue that I thought was going to be a mere  - where it seemed like my MacBook Pro (mid-2015) was 'freezing.' My only recourse was to press the power button for 10 seconds to shut the computer down, then press it again for a few more seconds to start it anew. 

I tend to leave my MBP running around the clock. Most often it would 'freeze' when I returned to it and attempted to wake it up from a sleeping state. 

I tried lots of things to fix this because it was driving me batty. Safe Mode didn't do it. I couldn't identify a particular application that might be causing the problem. I tried the OS cleaning tools to no avail. I finally got to the point where I wiped my MBP and reinstalled High Sierra; no changes, so I took it a step further and wiped, reinstalled with my original OS (Yosemite), and then upgraded to High Sierra again - the 'freezing' persisted! 

Like you, I assumed that my MBP was 'freezing up' until I ran across this article from GottaBeMobile: https://www.gottabemobile.com/fix-macos-high-sierra-problems/. The middle part of the article mentions <i>fixes for display problems</i> which got me thinking - maybe this isn't a 'freezing' problem, but a display problem. It fit because when I restarted during hours of darkness, I could see that the display was actually doing something because a minimal amount of illumination was perceptibly lost when I held the power button down for 10 seconds to execute a shutdown. 

Quoting the pertinent part of the article, it says: 

> If your Mac is having problems waking from sleep or you have display problems including gray screens, blue screens or flickering images on webpages you need to take the following actions.

> <b>First reset your NVRAM.</b> Turn off your Mac. Then turn it on and hold Command+Option+P+R while the computer is booting up. You will hear two chimes or on newer MacBook Pro models you will see the screen come on and go off twice.

> <b>Now, shut your computer down again and reset the SMC [System Management Controller].</b> With your Mac off, press Shift + Control + Option and then hold these keys while pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds.

> So far this has helped solve some of our most annoying macOS High Sierra problems.

I'm only 2 days into it, but this seems to have fixed my 'freezing' problem. So far High Sierra has waken up from its sleep state without giving me that stupid, blank screen stare and it's acting like the Mac I have come to know and love again... My thanks go out to Josh Smith from GottaBeMobile and I hope this helps you with your issue.
