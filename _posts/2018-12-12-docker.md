I am exploring Docker as a way to isolate project dependencies and run tests for my Python builds. Because Docker containers are ephemeral (i.e., when you shut a container down all the data is lost), I looked into implementing some kind of persistent storage with my containers. The following basic steps allow me to spin up a Docker container image with Ubuntu Linux, Python 3.7, and a storage volume that persists beyond the life of the container itself. 

>$ sudo docker create -v /JGdata --name JG_data derphilipp/ubuntu_bionic_with_python3_7`

>$ sudo docker run -it --volumes-from JG_data derphilipp/ubuntu_bionic_with_python3_7 /bin/bash`

Once logged in on the running container, I can find my persistent storage at:

># cd /JGdata`

Voila!!!
