I am trying to collate a series of .csv log files that are named by date (e.g., 2019-02-24.csv). There are a bunch of them, so I'm trying to script the process. I've crafted an AWK script that combines individual files: 

> awk ' FNR==1 { while (/"_time",PIN,FULLNAME,OFFICE,Acronym,Name/) getline; } 1 { print } ' 2019-01-01.csv >> usage_history.csv

But I am failing when I try to string the AWK commands together with a control loop in BASH:

>  for i in {01..28}; do echo "awk ' FNR==1 { while (/\"_time\",PIN,FULLNAME,OFFCODE,Acronym,Name/) getline; } 1 { print } ' 2019-01-$i.csv >> user_history.csv"; done

When I run this, it prints out the correct commands to the command line, but the awk scripts are not executed (they only get printed). If I run it without `echo`, I get errors telling me that the file doesn't exist; though all files are present: 

> bash: awk ' FNR==1 { while (/"_time",PIN,FULLNAME,OFFCODE,Acronym,Name/) getline; } 1 { print } ' 2019-01-01.csv >> user_history.csv: No such file or directory
