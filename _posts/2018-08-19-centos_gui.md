I have been running CentOS on an old laptop for a little while now. I initially set up a lab that mimicked my work environment, where I needed to work across Windows and Linux platforms to do the things I needed to do on the job. As time went by, I found myself expanding my little lab at home and branching out beyond what was available to me in the office.

I started off working purely on the command line with no real need for the graphical user interface. Over time I realized that I had a need for interactivity beyond the command line; particularly when I needed to reach out and find information (usually via a web browser). Some needs I was able to solve within the confines of the textual boundaries of CLI - email using [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org), even some preliminary internet searching using [Googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler), but there were still situations that required more. 

Eventually, I ended up updating my minimal installation of CentOS to a version that enabled the GNOME graphical user interface to ensure that I could leverage the desktop when I need it. But, I don't want to go there all the time. Not even, in fact, most of the time. 

It quickly became apparent that there's a difference between working purely on the command line and working in a terminal window on the desktop. I could just deal with it, but a lot of the time I spent on my CentOS machine wasn't actually ON the CentOS machine - instead I was logging in remotely through a secure shell (SSH) session from my Mac or even my iPad/iPhone -the former could handle sessions for a remote desktop, but my mobile devices would be hard pressed to work well with the GUI. Seeing as how this is a NIX environment, I was confident that I could bounce between CLI and GUI; all I needed to do was figure out which commands to run to flip the GUI/CLI switch...

As it turns out, there are two. I've got the CentOS machine set to boot up to the command line, so that's my starting point. Entering this command effectively puts me in GUI mode

`systemctl set-default multi-user.target`

`systemctl set-default graphical.target`
