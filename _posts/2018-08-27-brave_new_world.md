All in all a pretty decent read. Brave New World is an eighty-seven year old novel by Aldous Huxley that describes a futuristic society in which genetically-manufactured humans live in a want-free, drug-stabilized world that caters to mass production and consumption. There are a great many items that could be considered insightful, if not accurate, predictions of the future; many of which might be deemed to have come true. 

His description of always-youthful, ever-taut skin could easily be a preview of today's obsession with Botox or plastic surgery. Societal addiction to a drug called soma mimicks any number of drugs that can be found in your typical rave party cocktail. I don't think that the caste society is there, but we have a close second in the disparities between the haves and the have nots.
