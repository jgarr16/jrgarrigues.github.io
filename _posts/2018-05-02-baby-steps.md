I'm focusing on baby steps; doing a little bit of the things I want to excel at every day. Some days I'll do more, but at least a little every day. 

One of the things I am focusing on is Python - I won't be writing full-blown programs in a single sitting anytime soon, but if I can just eek out a small improvement to an existing project every day, I figure it will eventually pay dividends and I'll have something to show for my efforts. Plus - my skill level will improve and I'll be able to get more done in the little bit of time that I'm dedicating to coding every day because I'll be more proficient. 

Another is writing. Whether I'm writing here on my blog, or doing a paper for school, I want to make sure that there's some kind of writing happening every day. Not a novel; just a quick post (like this one!)

Maybe someday I'll be a prolific author about Python techniques, and I'll make a million dollars on my best-selling book!!!

Did I mention day dreaming - I _already_ do plenty of that every day!!!
