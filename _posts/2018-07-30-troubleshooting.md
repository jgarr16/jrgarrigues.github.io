In a previous life, I worked on an IT help desk. I've heard all the jokes about dealing with end users, [like when you ask the caller if their computer is plugged into the wall](http://jokes.cc.com/funny-miscellaneous/hib66e/from-the-wordperfect-help-desk). Yeah, everybody gets a chuckle out of that one, but one of the things that you learn quickly on the help desk is how important it is to keep it simple. Simple rules the day. 

A dozen years later, I find myself in a relationship...     ...with my MacBook Pro. I love this thing. Use it whenever I can, which is mostly at home since we use Windows at work. I've got my office set up so that I can dock it and use a big monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse when I'm at my desk using the MacOS closed-display feature. It all works great when I wear my Apple Watch, which unlocks my Mac when I get within range - technology! 

A few days ago, I realized that I couldn't get the computer to unlock like before. I'd just applied an update, so I started to wonder if a bug had crept in to the operating system. No matter what I tried, when I went to unlock the system, it wouldn't wake up and work while it was in the closed-display mode. When I pulled the Mac out and opened the lid it worked perfectly. Even the Apple Watch unlocking bit, but when it was docked, nada! Very frustrating. 

So I dove in deep. Started scouring the internet to see if others were reporting anything similar; hoping for a quick fix. Articles everywhere, but nothing that fit what I was experiencing. I ripped through the Apple site, digging for forum posts about closed-display issues. Found some, but not a good match for me. I searched everywhere. I finally ended up reading the Apple instructions for setting up closed-display mode and noticed a line buried deep in the article that said, "Make sure that your Mac notebook is plugged in to an outlet using the AC power adapter..." No Way! No Way! NO WAY! 

Way!!! Turns out that my power brick was plugged in to a wall socket somewhat precariously, and had slipped just far enough out of the plug to disconnect. No power coming in from the adapter meant - no closed-display mode for John. "Hey dummy, is it plugged into the wall?" After all that time, the joke was on me!
