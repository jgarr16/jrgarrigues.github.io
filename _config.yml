title_description: "I'm John, tinkerer, tweaker, and general dabbler from Baltimore, MD, USA. Iâ€™m currently working as an IT project manager in the public sector, but I am a lifelong learner and always strive to challenge myself. In my spare time, I enjoy studying, writing un-Pythonic code, and decomposing things that aren't supposed to be decomposed!"
